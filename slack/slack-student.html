        <p>Slack is an team communication service that we'll be using for this class. It's like a chat room, but with a lot of extra features that make it ideal for software teams. Many major organizations use Slack for their team communications.</p>

        <p>The instructor will set up a Slack workspace for this course, and provide instructions about signing up for it. Once you are signed up, you can <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/" target="_blank">download a Slack client</a> for your computer or mobile device.</p>

        <h3>Slack Channels</h3>
        <p>Communication in Slack is divided into channels. Most of our class-wide communication will happen in the #general channel.</p>

        <p>Once teams have been established, private team channels will be created for each team to use.</p>

        <p>In addition, you can send direct messages to your instructor (or to other students). In fact, if you have a pressing question about something, you can often get a response faster by sending a direct message to the instructor on Slack than by emailing.</p>

        <h3>Slack Etiquette</h3>
        <p>It's important to be professional in your online communications. Aside from the standard guidelines of not using ALL-CAPS TO COMMUNICATE and speaking respectfully, you should be aware of <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack" target="_blank">Slack-specific etiquette</a>.</p>
